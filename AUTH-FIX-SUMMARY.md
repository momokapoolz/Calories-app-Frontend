# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem
Users were being logged out after page reload even though they had successfully logged in. This was happening because the authentication state wasn't being properly persisted between page refreshes.

## Root Causes
1. The `AuthContext` wasn't properly restoring user state from localStorage on initial mount
2. The API client was aggressively clearing authentication on 401 errors
3. The `ProtectedRoute` component wasn't checking localStorage directly as a fallback

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. AuthContext Improvements
- Added immediate user state restoration from localStorage on initial mount
- Fixed the `checkAuth` function to properly set `isLoading` to false in all code paths
- Added user state restoration from localStorage during network errors
- Ensured the login function also stores user data in localStorage

### 2. API Client Improvements
- Added logic to prevent redirect loops by checking if we're already on an auth page
- Added more detailed error logging for authentication issues
- Removed automatic redirects on 401 errors, letting components handle redirection
- Added checks to avoid clearing auth state for login/register API calls

### 3. ProtectedRoute Component Improvements
- Added a direct localStorage check as a fallback authentication mechanism
- Improved rendering logic to show content if either context is authenticated or user exists
- Added logging to help diagnose authentication issues

## How It Works Now
1. When the app loads, it immediately checks localStorage for existing tokens and user data
2. If found, it sets the user state right away to prevent flickering
3. It then performs a background verification with the backend
4. If the backend is temporarily unavailable, it keeps the user logged in using localStorage data
5. The ProtectedRoute component has an additional safety check to prevent unnecessary redirects

## Testing
You should now be able to:
1. Log in successfully
2. Navigate to protected pages
3. Refresh the page and remain logged in
4. Close the browser and reopen it, and still be logged in (as long as localStorage persists)

If you still encounter issues, please check the browser console for detailed authentication logs that were added to help diagnose problems.
